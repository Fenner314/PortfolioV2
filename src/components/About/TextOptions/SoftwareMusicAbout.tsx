			<TextBlock>
				I lived the first 24 years of my life focusing on developing a career in
				music, specifically in trombone as a performer and teacher. After taking an
				entrepreneurship class while working towards my masters degree. From that
				class, I started introducing myself to coding and moved forward with the
				intention of incorporating that in an entrepreneurial role in my music
				career. As I became further immersed in the world of development, I became
				more passionate about it. That fact coupled with the impact COVID-19 had on
				the arts led to me shifting my focus from music to software development, and
				I haven’t looked back since.

			<TextBlock>
				Staying involved in the world of music is still important to me; I love
				supporting my wife, Taylor, in her opera career and attending her many
				performances. I try to keep my chops in shape by playing my trombone in my
				spare time, whether it’s on my own personal projects or with a local
				ensemble. Likewise, I enjoy making myself available to mentor other young
				musicians.
			</TextBlock>
			<TextBlock>
				My goal is to use my unique background in music to bring a different
				perspective to the teams and businesses I work with to create the best
				possible products that stand out from the competition.
